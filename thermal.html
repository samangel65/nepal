            <li><strong>Electrical Panels & Circuits:</strong> Use thermal imaging to identify overloaded circuits, short circuits, or failing components in electrical panels and distribution systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Solar Panel Inspections:</strong> Spot damaged or underperforming solar panels by identifying hot spots or irregularities in the panel's temperature distribution.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Building & Structural Inspections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Roof Inspections:</strong> Thermal drones can quickly and safely identify leaks, insulation gaps, or moisture intrusion in roofs, preventing costly water damage and energy inefficiencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Building Envelope Assessment:</strong> Detect thermal anomalies in walls, windows, and foundations, identifying areas where heat is lost and optimizing energy efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Facade Inspections:</strong> Monitor the condition of building exteriors and facades, identifying cracks, water ingress, or other issues affecting the building’s integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Industrial Inspections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HVAC Systems:</strong> Inspect HVAC units, ducts, and vents for temperature inconsistencies, leaks, or blockages, ensuring optimal performance and energy savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical & Manufacturing Equipment:</strong> Identify overheating motors, pumps, and machinery, preventing potential failures and costly downtime in manufacturing facilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Pipe & Insulation Inspections:</strong> Detect heat loss or leaks in insulated pipes, reducing energy waste and identifying potential hazards in industrial systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Agriculture & Crop Health Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crop Stress Detection:</strong> Use thermal drones to identify areas of crop stress, dehydration, or disease, enabling targeted interventions and more efficient use of resources like water and fertilizers.</li>
            <li><strong>Irrigation Monitoring:</strong> Assess the performance of irrigation systems, spotting leaks, blockages, or areas that are over- or under-watered, helping optimize water usage.</li>
            <li><strong>Livestock Monitoring:</strong> Monitor the health of livestock by detecting abnormal temperature patterns indicating illness or stress.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Search & Rescue Operations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thermal Search & Rescue:</strong> Use thermal cameras to locate missing persons in challenging environments, such as dense forests or during nighttime operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Detection:</strong> Identify hot spots in fire-affected areas, helping emergency services assess the extent of the fire and detect smoldering embers that may lead to further spread.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Environmental & Infrastructure Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pipeline Inspections:</strong> Detect leaks, corrosion, or signs of wear in oil, gas, and water pipelines, ensuring early intervention and reducing environmental risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Flood Monitoring:</strong> Thermal drones can monitor water levels and potential flooding risks, helping in disaster management and planning for flood-prone areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Dam & Reservoir Inspections:</strong> Identify temperature variations in dams and reservoirs that could indicate structural weaknesses or leaks.</li>
        </ul>
